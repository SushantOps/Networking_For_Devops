# what is IP Address?
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing. 

There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses are written as a series of four decimal numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.1.1. However, due to the limited number of available IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced, which uses a longer hexadecimal format, like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

IP addresses are essential for the proper functioning of the Internet, as they enable devices to find and communicate with each other over a network. Every device connected to the Internet, including computers, smartphones, and servers, is assigned a unique IP address to identify it on the network.

# what is IPv4 and IPv6 address?
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two versions of the Internet Protocol, which is the set of rules governing how data is sent and received over the Internet. Both versions are used to assign unique numerical addresses to devices on a network so that they can communicate with each other.

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):

- **Address Format:** IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical labels, typically expressed as four sets of decimal numbers separated by periods (dots). Each decimal number represents 8 bits of the 32-bit address. For example: 192.168.1.1.

- **Address Space:** IPv4 has a finite address space of 2^32 addresses, which is approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. This limitation has led to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses.

- **Usage:** Despite the depletion of IPv4 addresses, it is still widely used and the predominant version of the Internet Protocol.

### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):

- **Address Format:** IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numerical labels, expressed as eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons. For example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

- **Address Space:** IPv6 provides an immensely larger address space compared to IPv4, with 2^128 unique addresses. This vast address space is intended to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.

- **Usage:** IPv6 has been developed to address the limitations of IPv4 and to ensure the continued growth of the Internet. While its adoption has been slower than anticipated, it is becoming increasingly important as IPv4 addresses become scarce.

# How to calculate CIDR Range?
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a way of representing IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. The CIDR range is expressed as a combination of an IP address and a prefix length, separated by a forward slash (/). The prefix length indicates the number of bits set to "1" in the subnet mask.

Here's a general guide on how to calculate the CIDR range:

1. **Determine the Network Address:**
   - Given an IP address and its subnet mask, find the network address. The network address is obtained by performing a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask.

   Example:
   ```
   IP Address:    192.168.1.25
   Subnet Mask:   255.255.255.0
   Network Address: 192.168.1.0
   ```

2. **Count the Number of Host Bits:**
   - Subtract the prefix length from the total number of bits in an IP address to determine the number of host bits. For IPv4, there are 32 bits, and for IPv6, there are 128 bits.

   Example:
   ```
   Prefix Length:  24 (in IPv4)
   Number of Host Bits: 32 - 24 = 8
   ```

3. **Calculate the Number of Hosts:**
   - The number of hosts in a subnet is calculated as 2 to the power of the number of host bits, minus 2 (subtracting 2 to account for the network and broadcast addresses).

   Example:
   ```
   Number of Hosts: 2^8 - 2 = 254
   ```

4. **Determine the CIDR Notation:**
   - Combine the network address with the prefix length to express the CIDR range.

   Example:
   ```
   CIDR Notation: 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

Here's a brief overview using an IPv6 example:

1. **Determine the Network Address:**
   ```
   IP Address:    2001:0db8:85a3::1
   Prefix Length: 64
   Network Address: 2001:0db8:85a3::/64
   ```

2. **Count the Number of Host Bits:**
   ```
   Number of Host Bits: 128 - 64 = 64
   ```

3. **Calculate the Number of Hosts:**
   ```
   Number of Hosts: 2^64 - 2 (subtracting 2 to account for network and broadcast addresses)
   ```

4. **Determine the CIDR Notation:**
   ```
   CIDR Notation: 2001:0db8:85a3::/64
   ```

Calculating CIDR ranges is crucial for IP address management and efficient routing in networks. It allows for the aggregation of IP addresses into larger blocks, reducing the size of routing tables and improving overall network efficiency.

# what is subnetting?
Subnetting is a technique used in computer networking to divide and allocate IP address spaces more efficiently. It involves breaking down a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks, known as subnets. Subnetting provides several benefits, including improved network performance, efficient use of IP addresses, and enhanced security.

Here are key concepts and reasons for subnetting:

1. **Efficient IP Address Allocation:**
   - Subnetting allows an organization to allocate IP addresses more efficiently. Instead of assigning a single large address range to an entire network, the address space can be divided into smaller subnets, each serving a specific purpose or department.

2. **Reduced Broadcast Domain Size:**
   - In a subnet, devices within the same subnet can communicate directly with each other without the need for routers. This reduces the size of the broadcast domain, as broadcasts are contained within each subnet, leading to more efficient network communication.

3. **Improved Network Performance:**
   - Smaller broadcast domains and more localized traffic contribute to improved network performance. Subnetting helps manage network traffic by limiting the scope of broadcasts and reducing congestion.

4. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Subnetting provides a level of security by isolating different parts of the network. Access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules can be more easily applied to control traffic between subnets, enhancing network security.

5. **Simplified Network Management:**
   - Managing a large, flat network can be complex. Subnetting breaks down the network into smaller, more manageable sections, making it easier to configure and troubleshoot.

6. **Facilitates Hierarchical Routing:**
   - Subnetting supports hierarchical routing, allowing routers to make more efficient routing decisions. This can lead to better utilization of network resources and improved routing table efficiency.

7. **Facilitates Growth and Changes:**
   - Subnetting provides scalability by allowing an organization to allocate new subnets as needed. It also makes it easier to reorganize the network and adapt to changes in network structure or requirements.

**Subnetting Process:**
   - Choose an appropriate IP address range.
   - Determine the required number of subnets.
   - Determine the required number of hosts per subnet.
   - Select a suitable subnet mask based on the above requirements.
   - Allocate IP addresses to each subnet.

For example, if you have the IP address range 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24), you can subnet it into smaller subnets like 192.168.1.0/26, 192.168.1.64/26, and so on.

Subnetting is a fundamental skill for network administrators and engineers, and it plays a crucial role in designing and managing modern IP networks.

# Diff between Public and Private Subnet?
A public subnet and a private subnet are two distinct types of subnets within a network, primarily differentiated by their accessibility from the Internet. A public subnet is configured to have direct connectivity to the Internet, often hosting resources such as web servers or public-facing applications. Public subnets typically have a route to an Internet gateway, allowing outbound traffic to reach the Internet, and they are assigned public IP addresses that are routable on the global Internet.

On the other hand, a private subnet is designed to be isolated from direct Internet access and is intended for resources that should not be directly exposed to the public. This includes databases, application servers, or internal systems. Private subnets use Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow instances within the private subnet to initiate outbound connections to the Internet while keeping them hidden behind a single public IP address. This adds an extra layer of security, as resources in a private subnet are not directly reachable from external networks.

# What is the purpose of Ports in Networking?
In computer networking, ports play a crucial role in facilitating communication between different applications and services within a system. A port is a logical endpoint for network communications, and it is identified by a numerical value known as the port number. The combination of an IP address and a port number is used to uniquely identify a specific process or service on a device in a network. Here are the main purposes of ports in networking:

1. **Process Identification:**
   - Ports help identify specific processes or services running on a device. When data is sent over a network, the port number is used along with the IP address to route the information to the correct application or service.

2. **Multiplexing and Demultiplexing:**
   - Multiplexing is the process of combining multiple data streams into a single stream, and demultiplexing is the reverse process of separating the combined stream back into individual streams. Ports facilitate this by allowing multiple applications or services to run concurrently on a device, each with its own unique port number.

3. **Service Differentiation:**
   - Ports are standardized to represent specific services or protocols. For example, web traffic commonly uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. By using standardized port numbers, devices can easily identify the type of service or protocol being used, allowing for seamless communication between different systems.

4. **End-to-End Communication:**
   - Ports enable end-to-end communication between applications on different devices. When a device sends data to another device, the destination port helps the receiving device determine which application or service should handle the incoming data.

5. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Firewalls use port numbers to control the flow of traffic and enforce security policies. By allowing or blocking specific port numbers, administrators can control which services are accessible from the network and which are restricted, thereby enhancing network security.

6. **Socket Communication:**
   - Sockets are the combination of an IP address and a port number. They establish communication channels between applications on different devices. Sockets are fundamental for establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and managing network communication.

7. **Dynamic Port Assignment:**
   - Some ports are reserved for well-known services, but dynamic or ephemeral ports (those in the range 49152 to 65535) are assigned dynamically by the operating system for temporary use. These ports are typically used for client-side communication.

# what is OSI Model ?
![image](https://github.com/SushantOps/Networking_For_Devops/assets/109059766/8c3b04fc-331c-4a21-b25e-54e7ee4e0e6a)
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the OSI model serves as a reference for understanding and designing network architectures. Each layer in the OSI model has specific responsibilities, and communication between layers is defined by protocols. Here are the seven layers of the OSI model, from the lowest to the highest:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
   - **Function:** The physical layer deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware characteristics such as cables, connectors, voltage levels, and transmission rates. The primary focus is on transmitting raw bits over a physical medium.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
   - **Function:** The data link layer provides reliable point-to-point communication over the physical layer. It is responsible for framing, addressing, error detection, and flow control within a local network. Ethernet and Wi-Fi are examples of data link layer technologies.

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
   - **Function:** The network layer handles the routing and forwarding of data packets between devices on different networks. It is responsible for logical addressing, such as IP addresses, and determines the best path for data to travel between source and destination devices. Routers operate at the network layer.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
   - **Function:** The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication by providing error detection, error correction, and flow control. It is responsible for segmenting and reassembling data into manageable chunks. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operate at the transport layer.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5):**
   - **Function:** The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It manages dialog control, allowing data exchange to occur in full-duplex or half-duplex mode. Session layer services include session establishment, data synchronization, and session termination.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**
   - **Function:** The presentation layer is responsible for translating data between the application layer and the lower layers. It handles data compression, encryption, and character set conversions to ensure that data sent by one application can be properly interpreted by another. This layer deals with syntax and semantics of data.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7):**
   - **Function:** The application layer provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It enables communication between software applications and the network. Protocols at this layer include HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. This layer interacts directly with software applications, providing network services such as file transfer, email, and web browsing.


# what is TCP/IP Model?
![image](https://github.com/SushantOps/Networking_For_Devops/assets/109059766/72ec1437-a3b0-4d32-9812-efcc1edd0727)
The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet protocol suite, is a conceptual framework used for designing and understanding networking protocols and communication over the Internet. It is named after its two most important protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). The TCP/IP model consists of four layers, each responsible for specific functions. Here are the layers of the TCP/IP model, from the lowest to the highest:

1. **Link Layer (or Network Interface Layer):**
   - **Function:** Equivalent to the combination of the OSI model's physical and data link layers. The Link Layer deals with the physical and logical connections to the network medium, including hardware addressing, framing, and error detection. Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP are examples of link layer technologies.

2. **Internet Layer:**
   - **Function:** Equivalent to the OSI model's network layer. The Internet Layer is responsible for routing packets between different networks. It uses logical addressing (IP addresses) to identify devices on a network and determines the best path for data transmission. The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer.

3. **Transport Layer:**
   - **Function:** Similar to the OSI model's transport layer. The Transport Layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication, segmenting and reassembling data, providing error detection, and managing flow control. The primary protocols at this layer are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

4. **Application Layer:**
   - **Function:** Similar to the OSI model's presentation and application layers combined. The Application Layer provides network services directly to end-users or applications. It supports communication between software applications and the network. Protocols at this layer include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.


# Diff between OSI and TCP/IP model?

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model are both conceptual frameworks used to understand and design network protocols. While they share similarities, they differ in terms of structure, layering, and historical development. Here are some key differences between the OSI model and the TCP/IP model:

1. **Number of Layers:**
   - **OSI Model:** The OSI model consists of seven layers, each with a specific set of functions. The layers, from the lowest to the highest, are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
   - **TCP/IP Model:** The TCP/IP model comprises four layers: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. The functions of the lower layers of the OSI model are combined into the Link layer of the TCP/IP model, and the Presentation and Session layers are combined into the Application layer.

2. **Layer Functions:**
   - **OSI Model:** Each layer in the OSI model has well-defined functions, and each layer communicates with the layers directly above and below it. The model emphasizes a clear separation of concerns and responsibilities.
   - **TCP/IP Model:** The TCP/IP model combines functions from multiple OSI layers into a smaller number of layers. For example, the TCP/IP model's Application layer encompasses both the Presentation and Application layers of the OSI model.

3. **Development History:**
   - **OSI Model:** Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to provide a comprehensive framework for networking standards. While widely used for educational purposes, the OSI model had limited adoption in real-world implementations.
   - **TCP/IP Model:** Evolved from the ARPANET project and was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. It gained prominence as the Internet protocol suite and became the de facto standard for networking.

4. **Practical Implementation:**
   - **OSI Model:** Although the OSI model is a theoretical framework, it is not as commonly implemented in practice. It serves as a reference model for understanding network concepts.
   - **TCP/IP Model:** The TCP/IP model is directly tied to the development of the Internet and is widely used in practical networking implementations. TCP/IP protocols form the basis of the global Internet.

5. **Layer Names:**
   - **OSI Model:** The layer names are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
   - **TCP/IP Model:** The layer names are Link, Internet, Transport, and Application.
