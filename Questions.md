# what is IP Address?
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing. 

There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses are written as a series of four decimal numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.1.1. However, due to the limited number of available IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced, which uses a longer hexadecimal format, like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

IP addresses are essential for the proper functioning of the Internet, as they enable devices to find and communicate with each other over a network. Every device connected to the Internet, including computers, smartphones, and servers, is assigned a unique IP address to identify it on the network.
